UPGRADING
=========

Instructions on how to upgrade from the last stable release of Scuttle are detailed on our Wiki:

http://scuttle.org/wiki/doku.php?id=upgrading

===
API
===

Scuttle supports most of the del.icio.us API [ http://del.icio.us/doc/api ]. Almost all of the neat tools made for that system can be modified to work with your installation instead. If you find a tool that won't let you change the API address, ask the creator to add this setting. You never know, they might just do it.
